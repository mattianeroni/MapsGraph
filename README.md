# MapsGraph
The repository contains all the instruments to do webscraping on OpenMaps, estrapolate the content formalized as a Graph, and optimize the logistics on these roads.
All these tools have been integrated in a simple ready-to-use class.

I would like to point out that nothing "new" is introduced in this repository. This is just a collections of tools already existent in networkx and geopython.
